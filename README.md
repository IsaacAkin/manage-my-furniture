# Furniture Calalogue

This is a website that I am making for my girlfriend. She's planning to buy a house so we recently went to Ikea to look at some furniture. We took pictures of things that she liked so I thought it would be a good idea to make a website where she is able to upload the images of things that she liked and categorise them for easier management of the things that she wants.
